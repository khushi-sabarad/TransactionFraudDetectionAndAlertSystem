# Transaction Fraud Detection & Alert System

This Python script analyzes a batch of financial transaction data to detect potentially fraudulent transactions based on predefined rules. It uses Pandas to process the data and identifies high-value transactions and location anomalies.

## Features

* Loads transaction data from a CSV file.
* Detects high-value transactions based on a fixed threshold.
* Identifies location anomalies based on user's historical location data.
* Generates a report summarizing the detected anomalies.
* Produces alert messages for suspicious activity.

## Usage

1.  Place your transaction data in a CSV file named `transactions.csv`.
2.  Run the script: `python fraud_detection.py`

## Future Considerations and Improvements

While this script provides a basic framework for fraud detection, it can be significantly improved to reflect real-world scenarios:

* **Dynamic Transaction Thresholds:**
    * The current fixed threshold for high-value transactions does not account for variations in user spending patterns or economic contexts. In a real-world system, thresholds should be dynamic and user-specific.
    * Consider calculating thresholds based on:
        * User's income or average spending.
        * Location-specific economic indicators.
        * Transaction frequency.
* **Currency Conversion:**
    * If dealing with international transactions, currency conversion is essential. A fixed threshold across different currencies is not meaningful.
* **Card-Based Location Anomalies:**
    * Users may have multiple cards with different spending patterns or location usage. Location anomalies should be tracked per card rather than per user.
* **Expanded Fraud Rules:**
    * Implement more sophisticated rules, such as:
        * Time-based anomalies (e.g., unusual transaction times).
        * Frequent transactions within a short period.
        * Velocity checks (sudden increase in transaction volume).
* **Machine Learning:**
    * Integrate machine learning models to detect more complex fraud patterns.
* **Real-time Alerts:**
    * Implement real-time alerting via email, SMS, or a dashboard.
* **Database Integration:**
    * Store transaction data in a database for efficient querying and analysis.
* **Logging:**
    * Add robust logging for audit trails and debugging.
